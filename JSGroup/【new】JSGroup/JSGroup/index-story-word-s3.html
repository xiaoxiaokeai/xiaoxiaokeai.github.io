 How big is the world? How can Santa send gifts to all the children overnight? So there is the existence of Santa Claus Village.<br> In this village, there are Santa Claus in every country.<br><br>
About Santa Claus, it is said that Santa Claus is the descendants of the God odin. It is thousands of years in the Scandinavia Peninsula, northern myth of our wisdom, art, poetry, the war god Odin, the winter season, riding his eight foot horse ride in<br> the remotest corners of the globe, good and evil, distribute gifts. At the same time, the son of Thor to a red lightning as a<br> weapon and the snow gods pitch-dark fierce battle, the final victory over the cold.<br><br>
Once there was a kind-hearted aristocrat, his wife died of illness, leaving him and his three daughters. The aristocrat tried<br> many inventions and failed, but he also ran out of money, so they had to move to a farmhouse, and his daughters had to<br> cook, sew and clean themselves.<br><br>
A few years later, the daughters were getting married, and the father became more depressed because he had no money to <br>buy dowry for her daughters.<br><br>
One night, after the girls washed their clothes, they hung the stockings in front of the fireplace and dried them. The sage<br> Nicholas came to their house that night after knowing their father's situation. He saw from the window that the family had<br> fallen asleep and also noticed the stockings of the girls. Then he took out three small bags of gold from his pocket and<br> threw it down the chimney, just falling into the girls' stockings.<br><br>
On the second morning, the daughters woke up to find their stockings filled with gold enough for them to buy dowry. This<br> aristocrat can also see his daughters marry and live happily ever after.<br><br>
Later, children from all over the world inherited the tradition of hanging Christmas stockings. In some countries, children<br> have other similar customs, such as in France, children put their shoes near the fireplace and so on.<br><br>
The world - famous Santa Claus's House is located in the Arctic Circle 8 kilometers north of Rovaniemi. Every year a stream<br> of tourists flocked from all over the world to get a glimpse of Santa Claus.
