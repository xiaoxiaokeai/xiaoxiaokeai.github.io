<h2>agree or disagree</h2>

<p>With the years gone by, I have found that more and more people that I met have different views from mine.</p>
<p>Sometimes I couldn't even use the word "different" to describe this, because our views were almost conflicting.</p>
<p>In the past, I used to tend to argue with people like this. I always wanted to persuade them all and make them accept my view while admitting that they themselves were wrong.</p>
<p>But as time passed by I gradually came to realize that what I had been doing might be not right.</p>
<p>Every person has different experience. And our views are extracted from our own experiences.</p>

<p>Once there was a scientist. He wanted to study how monkeys learn.</p>

<p>Sometimes, and quite often, when we encounter complex situations, we are just like this monkey.</p>

<p>We don't calm ourselves down and try to find a solution for the problem. We merely fight a pointless fight methodlessly with the problem.</p>

<div class="minds">
<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>Reading is not just about learning a certain skill.</p>

<p>Nor is it just about learning how to create prettier combination of words.</p>

<p>Reading is a form of communication which is in a higher rank than mere conversation.</p>
